OpenMC Fusion Benchmarks is a platform for V&V of fusion neutronics. It focuses on fusion-relevant integral benchmarks. It relies on an automated workflow for model simulation, data postprocessing, visualization and analysis. It embeds a database of experimental and numerical results for quick comparisons to which users can contribute to. The database contribution workflow is fully automated.
